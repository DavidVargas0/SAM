**Sustainable Analytical Model (SAM)** is an open-source software designed to help engineers create analytical models of energy-efficient buildings. It enables the creation and analysis of energy models of buildings, including heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting.

SAM allows users to create energy models in a variety of ways, including importing building geometry from common architectural software such as Revit or gbXML, manually inputting building geometry, or generating geometry using SAM's built-in tools. Once the geometry is defined, users can assign construction properties, internal loads, and system configurations to the model.

SAM uses an energy simulation engine to predict the energy performance of the building. The simulation results can be used to compare different design scenarios, assess compliance with building codes and standards, and evaluate the effectiveness of energy-saving strategies.

SAM also includes several tools for post-processing and visualizing the simulation results. Users can view the results in various formats, including graphs, tables, and 3D models, and export the data for further analysis.

SAM is designed to be extensible, and users can add new features and functionalities by developing custom plugins. It is integrated with several third-party tools and frameworks, including Ladybug Tools, BHoM, and Topologic, which enhance its capabilities and enable more advanced workflows.

## Getting Started

To install **SAM**, download and run the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/HoareLea/SAM_Deploy/releases) page or rebuild using Visual Studio from the [SAM repository](https://github.com/HoareLea/SAM).
